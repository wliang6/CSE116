CSE116 - WRITE-UP #1

Define a method named 'solution', in a class named 'WriteUp', in a package named 'code',
as follows:

	/**
	 * @param s, a String
	 * @param c, a character
	 * @return true if c occurs 2 or more times in a row
	 *         false otherwise 
	 *  
	 * Keep in mind that the String s could be null,
	 * or a reference to *any* valid Java String.
	 * 
	 * Here are some examples:
	 * 
	 * solution(null,'a') must return false
	 *
	 * solution("",'a') must return false
	 *
	 * solution("an aardvark is able",'a') must return true (since 'a'
	 *   occurs next to 'a' in 'aardvark')
	 *
	 * solution("b..b..blistering blue barnacles",'b') must return false
	 *
	 * solution("AAAb",'a') must return false (since 'A' != 'a')
	 * 
	 * solution("AAAb",'A') must return true
	 * 
	 * The only methods you may call on the String s are charAt(int) and length().
