	 * contains the items in the arrays r and s interleaved.  For example, if 
	 * r contains 1, 3, and 5, in that order, and s contains 2, 4, and 6 (in that
	 * order) then the result must contain 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (in that order).
	 * 
	 * You can assume that r and s will either have the same size, or r will
	 * contain just one more item than s.  For example, if r contains 1, 3, and 5,
	 * in that order, and s contains just 2 and 4 (in that order) then the result
	 * must contain 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 (in that order).
