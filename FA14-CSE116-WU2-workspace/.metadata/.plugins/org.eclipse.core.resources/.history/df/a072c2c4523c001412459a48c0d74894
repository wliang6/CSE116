CSE116 Fall 2014 - WRITE-UP #2

Define a method as described below.  Your method must be in a class that is
defined in a named package (i.e. NOT the default package), as long as the package name
is not 'tests' nor 'util'.

/**************************************************************************
 * @param s is a String (the sole parameter of the method)
 * @return an int[] of size 3, containing the character counts as described 
 * below.
 *
 * Definitions:
 *
 * [group0] A character ch is in group0 if and only if
 *          ( 'a' <= ch AND ch <= 'z' ) OR ( 'A' <= ch AND ch <= 'Z' )  
 *
 * [group0A] The following characters are in group0A: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'
 *               as are their upper-case equivalents: 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E'. 
 *
 * [group0B] A character which is in group0 but is not in group0A is in group0B.
 *
 * [group1] Any character which is not in group0 is in group1.
 *
 * The count of group0A characters must be in position 0 of the array,
 * the count of group0B characters must be in position 1 of the array, and
 * the count of group1 characters must be in position 2 of the array.
 * 
 * Some examples:
 * 
 * if s is "", then:
 *     all entries in the array must be 0.
 * if s is "c", then:
 *     all entries in the array must be 0 except for entry 0, which must be 1.
 * if s is "Now I know my abc's", then:
 *     entry 0 of the array must be  3 (because there are three members of group0A: 'a', 'b', 'c')
 *     entry 1 of the array must be 11 (because there are eleven member of group0B: 'N', 'o', 'w', 'I', 'k', 'n', 'o', 'w', 'm', 'y', 's'), and
 *     entry 2 of the array must be  5 (because there are five members of group1: ' ' (the space character occurs four times) and ',').
 * 
 * The only methods you may call on the String s are charAt(int) and length().
 *
 * You may use the static toLowerCase method defined in the Character class,
 * which maps a char to its lower-case equivalent.  For example,
 *     Character.toLowerCase('a') returns 'a'
 *     Character.toLowerCase('A') returns 'a'
 *     Character.toLowerCase('B') returns 'b'
 *     Character.toLowerCase('J') returns 'j'
 *     Character.toLowerCase('%') returns '%'
 * 
 * You may, if you wish, define private helper methods that you call from your
 * character counting method.
