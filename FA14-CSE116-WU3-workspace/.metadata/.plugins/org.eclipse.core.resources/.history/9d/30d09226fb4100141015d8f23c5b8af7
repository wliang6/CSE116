CSE116 Write-Up #3

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:
--------------------
Your task is to define a class with one method, described below.

Your class must be defined in a package 'code' placed in the 'src' folder.

Your class must be named 'WriteUp'.

Your method must be non-static and named 'solution'.  Its return type must be
'HashMap<String,Integer>' and its parameter must be of type 'String'.  Your
class must have a no-argument constructor. 

The functionality of your definitions will be verified by JUnit tests.


HOMEWORK-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
------------------------------

A description of the required (public) method:

	/**************************************************************************
	 * @param a String denoting the inputPath the path on the local filesystem
	 *        to the input file
	 * @returns a HashMap<String,Integer> containing the word->count mappings
	 *
	 * This method must read the contents of a file (identified by inputFilePath),
	 * one char at a time, segment the input into words, and keep track of word
	 * counts in a java.util.HashMap<String,Integer>. 
	 * 
	 * A word is defined as a contiguous sequence of characters that does not
	 * contain word separator characters, where word separator characters are:
	 *   ' '   space
	 *   '\n'  newline
	 *   '\t'  tab
	 *   ','   comma
     *   '.'   period
     *   ':'   colon
     *   ';'   semicolons
     * 
     * Think carefully about this definition, and how it applies to an initial
     * character sequence not preceded by a word separator, and also a final 
     * character sequence not followed by a word separator.
	 *   
	 * You must use only CharacterFromFileReader to read characters from the input
	 * file.  Use it as an Iterator<Character>, keeping in mind the autoboxing &
	 * unboxing feature of the Java language.
	 * 
	 * In order to keep your code readable, break your code into several methods.
	 * Define meaningful private helper methods that you call from the required
	 * public method.
